CRITICAL

HIGH
- text instead of icons? (home, contact, etc)
- lag on Chrome (getTextureData? memcpy??)

MEDIUM
- mobile
- lively details (react on hover, fade in as you scroll, etc)
- smarter should-redraw logic
- release mode crash
- better UI for gallery

LOW
- film grain
- LUT
- animation of loading dots
- numbers in project page are weird
