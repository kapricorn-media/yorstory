CRITICAL
- space between "boarding the mechanics" and text should be the same as home
- grid with blank squares
- "other projects" with a frame
- number stickers on top of subtitle
- font rasterizing is slow
- "Projects" module should keep scrolling, not stop

HIGH
- gallery changes (layout)
- number stickers font
- grid size3
- lag on Chrome (getTextureData? memcpy??)

MEDIUM
- sticker on top of "we are storytellers"
- try font oversampling
- fix kerning
- flare layer, opacity sine wave 100% <-> 20% 
- lively details (react on hover, fade in as you scroll, etc)
- mobile parallax ?
- smarter should-redraw logic
- release mode crash
- better UI for gallery

LOW
- grid images face cursor
- film grain
- LUT
- animation of loading dots
- numbers in project page are weird
