CRITICAL
- parallax scene loading is slow (images are massive)
- load yorstory.wasm immediately or ASAP

HIGH
- gallery changes (layout + popup)
- grid size3
- sticker on top of "we are storytellers"

MEDIUM
- lively details (react on hover, fade in as you scroll, etc)
- flare layer, opacity sine wave 100% <-> 20% 
- smarter should-redraw logic
- fix kerning
- space between "boarding the mechanics" and text should be the same as home (based on baseline, not pure text bounding box size)

LOW
- font loading kicks off web worker, and on resize we want to re-generate font. should have a way to cancel the in-flight font loading job before submitting another one.
- mobile parallax ?
- grid images face cursor
- film grain
- animation of loading dots
- multithread bigdata generation
